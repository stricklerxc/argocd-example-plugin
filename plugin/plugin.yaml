  # The init command runs in the Application source directory at the beginning of each manifest generation. The init
  # command can output anything. A non-zero status code will fail manifest generation.
  init:
    # Init always happens immediately before generate, but its output is not treated as manifests.
    # This is a good place to, for example, download chart dependencies.
    command: [sh]
    args: [-c, 'echo "Initializing..."']
  # The generate command runs in the Application source directory each time manifests are generated. Standard output
  # must be ONLY valid Kubernetes Objects in either YAML or JSON. A non-zero exit code will fail manifest generation.
  # Error output will be sent to the UI, so avoid printing sensitive information (such as secrets).
  generate:
    command: [/home/plugin/generate.sh]
  # The discovery config is applied to a repository. If every configured discovery tool matches, then the plugin may be
  # used to generate manifests for Applications using the repository. If the discovery config is omitted then the plugin 
  # will not match any application but can still be invoked explicitly by specifying the plugin name in the app spec. 
  # Only one of fileName, find.glob, or find.command should be specified. If multiple are specified then only the 
  # first (in that order) is evaluated.
  discover:
    # fileName is a glob pattern (https://pkg.go.dev/path/filepath#Glob) that is applied to the Application's source 
    # directory. If there is a match, this plugin may be used for the Application.
    fileName: "./*/*.yaml.erb"
  # The parameters config describes what parameters the UI should display for an Application. It is up to the user to
  # actually set parameters in the Application manifest (in spec.source.plugin.parameters). The announcements _only_
  # inform the "Parameters" tab in the App Details page of the UI.
  parameters:
    # Static parameter announcements are sent to the UI for _all_ Applications handled by this plugin.
    # Think of the `string`, `array`, and `map` values set here as "defaults". It is up to the plugin author to make 
    # sure that these default values actually reflect the plugin's behavior if the user doesn't explicitly set different
    # values for those parameters.
